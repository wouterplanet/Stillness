# Stillness 🌿

**Breathe. Click. Color. Let the world dissolve.**

Stillness is a browser-based coloring book designed for the moments when your mind needs a quiet place to land. No accounts. No ads. No noise — just you, a canvas of intricate patterns, and colors that feel like a deep exhale.

Choose from hand-crafted mandalas, flowing florals, ocean dreamscapes, and more. Fill regions with a single click, paint freehand with a soft brush, or layer gentle gradients — all accompanied by ambient chimes, birdsong, or the hush of distant waves.

Built for stillness. Open it when the day feels loud.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Single-file app (`index.html`) — no build step, no dependencies to install.

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Rendering | [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) (CDN) | Vector canvas, hit-testing, zoom/pan, SVG export |
| Audio | Web Audio API | Synthesized ambient sounds (no audio files needed) |
| UI | Vanilla CSS + JS | Dark-mode interface, responsive layout |
| Fonts | [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) (Google Fonts) | Clean, modern typography |

### How Patterns Work
Each pattern is a generator function that creates **Paper.js closed paths** — every enclosed region is an individually clickable and fillable item. The fill tool uses Paper.js `hitTest()` for precise vector hit-testing (no pixel scanning), which means fills are instant and crisp at any zoom level.

### Undo System
Uses a **command pattern** — each fill/brush operation is recorded as a reversible command object, enabling efficient undo/redo without storing full canvas snapshots.
